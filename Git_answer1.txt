What is the difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch'? - 

Git fetch is the command that tells your local git to retrieve the latest meta-data
info from the original (yet doesnâ€™t do any file transferring) 
while git pull on the other hand does that ans brings (copy) those changes 
from the remote repository.
